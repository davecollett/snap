Running test for order 3
   Absolute accuracy maximum = 1000.000 m
   Absolute accuracy maximum to nearest control = 1000.000 m +/- 1000.0000 m/100m
   Relative accuracy by abs accuracy = 0.000 m
   Maximum range for relative accuracy test = 0.0 m
   Relative accuracy maximum = 4.000 m +/- 0.0000 m/100m
==============================================================
Running test for order 6
   Absolute accuracy maximum = 1000.000 m
   Absolute accuracy maximum to nearest control = 1000.000 m +/- 1000.0000 m/100m
   Relative accuracy by abs accuracy = 0.000 m
   Maximum range for relative accuracy test = 0.0 m
   Relative accuracy maximum = 6.000 m +/- 0.0000 m/100m
