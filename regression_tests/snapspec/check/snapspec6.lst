Loading marks for SDC tests
    Station 1 is a control mark
    Station 2 is to be tested. Error H/V = 0.00000000/0.04000000 m2
    Station 3 is to be tested. Error H/V = 0.00000000/0.04040000 m2
    Station 4 is to be tested. Error H/V = 0.00000000/1.00000000 m2
    Station 5 is to be tested. Error H/V = 0.00000000/1.03999996 m2
    Station 6 is to be tested. Error H/V = 0.00000000/1.03999996 m2

Finding nearest control for each mark
    Station 2 is 500.01 m2 from control
    Station 3 is 2000.03 m2 from control
    Station 4 is 3604.06 m2 from control
    Station 5 is 6409.10 m2 from control
    Station 6 is 10009.15 m2 from control
   .. Identified nearest control marks took 0.00 seconds (total 0.00 seconds)
   .. Commencing tests for order 5 took 0.00 seconds (total 0.00 seconds)

Running test for order 5
 Vertical accuracy tests
   Absolute accuracy maximum = 1000.000 m
   Absolute accuracy maximum to nearest control = 1000.000 m +/- 1000.0000 m/100m
   Relative accuracy by abs accuracy = 0.000 m
   Maximum range for relative accuracy test = 0.0 m
   Relative accuracy maximum = 0.300 m +/- 0.0000 m/100m
Applying absolute accuracy test
   .. Absolute accuracy test complete took 0.00 seconds (total 0.00 seconds)
Setting up array for relative accuracy tests
   .. Relative accuracy tests initiated took 0.00 seconds (total 0.00 seconds)
Applying relative accuracy test
   .. Setting up relative accuracy status took 0.00 seconds (total 0.00 seconds)

  Pass 1: Using existing covariance information
   Relative vrt accuracy fail by absolute    Station 2 fails on rel vrt accuracy to passed station 1 (0.04000000 > 0.01502124)
   Relative vrt accuracy fail by absolute    Station 3 fails on rel vrt accuracy to passed station 1 (0.04040000 > 0.01502124)
   Relative vrt accuracy fail by absolute    Station 4 fails on rel vrt accuracy to passed station 1 (1.00000000 > 0.01502124)
