<p class="Commanddefinition">fix  [automatically] [type]  [all]  [station_list]</p>

<p>Defines which stations are to be constrained to be fixed in the adjustment.  
That is their coordinates are not calculated but are treated as being exactly correct.  
By default all stations are adjusted if there are observations to them.  
The parameters are:</p>

<p class="Commanddefinition">automatically</p>
<p class="Commanddescription">if present specifies that the constraint is only applied it appears to be necessary. See below for more details.
</p>
<p class="Commanddefinition">type</p><p class="Commanddescription">specifies which coordinates are to be fixed.  It can be one of "horizontal",  "vertical", or "3d".  If the <code>type</code> is omitted then all the station coordinates are held fixed.</p>

<p class="Commanddefinition">all</p><p class="Commanddescription">may be included if you want to fix all stations.  You can then use the free command to select a few stations that are to be adjusted.  (This is useful if you only want to adjust a few stations).</p>

<p class="Commanddefinition">station_list</p><p class="Commanddescription">is a list of stations to be held fixed separated by blank spaces. </p>

<p>Here are some examples of the fix command</p>

<p class="Commanddefinition">
fix all<br>
fix automatically all<br>
fix 1  5  23<br>
fix horizontal 1A BM3 50-55 <br>
fix vertical 3 4 5A<br>
fix 3d order=1 order=2 order=3
</p>

<p>Automatically constraining stations is not guaranteed to be sufficient for a solution.  
The constraints are applied based upon the types of observations to the station. Snap tests for observations which
provide bearing, distance, height difference from another station, 3d positions, latitude, longitude, and heights.
It will only constrain a station if there are no observations to the station that are influenced by the constraint.
This is not completely rigorous, in that all horizontal distance types and bearing types are 
treated as independent of height, so a height will not be calculated if there are only these types of observations 
to a station.  If this is a concern then only automatically fix station vertically 
(use &quot;fix automatically vertical all&quot;).  This may result in
an ill conditioned adjustment if there no height observations to marks with just these horizontal observation
types.
</p>

<p>Note that &quot;fix automatically 3d&quot; will fix vertically or horizontally as necessary.  It will
never fix a station both ways - stations for which neither horizontal or vertical coordinates can be 
calculated will be rejectd.

Use the command <a href="cmd_list.html">list problem_definition</a> command to see a list of stations automatically
fixed.
