<h1><a name="snapspec"></a>Snapspec configuration file</h1>

<p>Snapspec uses a configuration file
to defining the specifications
for each order to be tested.  The name of the configuration file
can be specified on the snapspec command line - by default it is called snapspec.cfg.  
Snapspec will look for the configuration file first in the same 
directory as the snap binary file, and then in the directory in which the 
snapspec program is installed.
</p>

<h2>Configuration commands</h2>
<p>
The configuration file includes both 
general settings and the specifications of orders.  It can also
include comments on lines beginning with "!".  Each setting is defined on a line in 
which the first word is the command name, and the following text define the 
command options. The file can include the following commands.
</p>

<p class="CommandDefinition">test <i>test definition</i></p>
<p class="CommandDescription">Each order is defined by a test command, which specifies the accuracy requirements a 
station must achieve to be assigned to that order.  The accuracy requirement comprises a number
of components as defined by the <a href="algorithm.html">snapspec algorithm</a>.  These are:</p>
<table class="CommandDescription">
<tr>
<td class="nobr">h_abs_max  <i>##</i> mm</td>
 <td>The maximum absolute horizontal error of coordinates</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="nobr">h_rel_to_control <i>##</i> mm <i>##</i> ppm</td>
 <td>The maximum horizontal error relative to a control station (includes a distance dependent component).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="nobr">h_rel <i>##</i> mm <i>##</i> ppm</td>
 <td>The maximum permissible horizontal relative error of coordinates.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="nobr">h_rel_min_abs <i>##</i> mm</td>
 <td>Coordinates with an absolute horizontal error less than this are assumed to pass the relative accuracy tests (allows more efficient processing or relative accuracy tests).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="nobr">v_abs_max  <i>##</i> mm</td>
 <td>The maximum absolute vertical error of coordinates</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="nobr">v_rel_to_control <i>##</i> mm <i>##</i> ppm</td>
 <td>The maximum vertical error relative to a control station (includes a distance dependent component).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="nobr">v_rel <i>##</i> mm <i>##</i> ppm</td>
 <td>The maximum permissible vertical relative error of coordinates.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="nobr">v_rel_min_abs <i>##</i> mm</td>
 <td>Coordinates with an absolute vertical error less than this are assumed to pass the relative accuracy tests (allows more efficient processing or relative accuracy tests).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="nobr">range <i>#####</i> m</td>
 <td>The maximum length of line for which relative accuracy tests are applied</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="nobr">autorange</td>
 <td>If present then the maximum length for relative accuracy tests will be based upon the distance to the nearest control mark.</td>
</tr>

</table>
<p class="CommandDefinition">confidence <i>percentage</i></p>
<p class="CommandDescription">
Defines the confidence level to be used for calculating error ellipses and vertical errors for testing accuracy.
</p>
<p class="CommandDefinition">vertical_error_factor <i>factor</i></p>
<p class="CommandDescription">
Defines the factor by which vertical errors are multiplied when comparing them with horizontal orders in order
to choose which station to reject (see the description of the snapspec algorithm). (Note: this is only used in 
selecting stations, not in calculating the vertical error for vertical accuracy tests)
</p>
<p class="CommandDefinition">error_type <i>apriori</i>|<i>aposteriori</i></p>
<p class="CommandDescription">
Defines whether the accuracy tests are based on apriori or aposteriori statistics.
</p>
<p class="CommandDefinition">default_order <i>order</i></p>
<p class="CommandDescription">
Specifies the order that will be assigned to stations that fail to meet the accuracy standard for any of the 
orders.
</p>
<p class="CommandDefinition">limit_order <i>order  station_list</i></p>
<p class="CommandDescription">
Specifies the best (most accuracte) order that specific stations will be considered for.  
The <a href="../../files/cmdcfg/cmd_stn_list.html">station list</a> can include specific
stations, or groups of stations identified by classification.
</p>
<p class="CommandDefinition">set_priority <i>priority station_list</i></p>
<p class="CommandDescription">
Sets the priority of the selected stations to <i>priority</i> - an integer value. The higher the
value the lower the priority.  Higher priority stations are preferred for each order.
</p>
<p class="CommandDefinition">ignore <i>station_list</i></p>
<p class="CommandDescription">
The specified stations will be ignored in the order calculation.
</p>
<p class="CommandDefinition">configuration <i>configuration_file_name</i></p>
<p class="CommandDescription">
Reads additional configuration information from a separate configuration file.
</p>
<p class="CommandDefinition">station_configuration_file <i>station_config_file</i> <i>csv</i></p>
<p class="CommandDescription">
The station configuration file assigns best potential order and/or priority to stations.  
The format is space delimited by default, but can this can be a CSV file if the <i>csv</i> option
is specified.  The first line defines the fields in the file, which must be
&quot;code&quot; and then &quot;order&quot; and/or &quot;priority&quot;.  Additional fields in
the file are ignored.  Orders can be any order defined in the configuration, and priorities are positive integer numbers.  
Either the priority or order fields can contain &quot;*&quot; which will cause the station to be 
ignored.
Empty fields and fields containing just &quot;-&quot; are ignored.
</p>
<p class="CommandDefinition">options <i>option ...</i></p>
<p class="CommandDescription">
Specifies options controlling the tests.  The following options can be used:
</p>
<ul class="CommandDescription">
<li>only_test_orders_worse_than_control: limits the order tests to orders worse than the lowest ordered control station.  
    This is equivalent to the snapspec -a command line option.</li>
<li>no_rel_acc_by_abs_optimisation: This disables the optimisation to avoid calculating relative accuracies for tests where
the absolute accuracy information is sufficient</li> 
<li>strict_rel_acc_by_abs_optimisation: This makes the optimisation rigorous by not assuming positive correlation
    between mark coordinates. This makes the optimisation less efficient. </li> 
</ul>
<p class="CommandDefinition">log_level <i>level</i></p>
<p class="CommandDescription">
Defines the amount of information recorded in the log file.  This may be useful for analysing the assignment of
station orders when the results are unexpected.  This is a numeric value calculated by adding the following 
options
</p>
<table class="CommandDescription">
<tr><td>1</td><td>list the steps used in assigning orders</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>lists details of specific tests</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>lists details of accuracy calculations</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>lists calculated distances</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>lists additional information about relative accuracy calcs</td></tr>
<tr><td>32&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>lists timings of accuracy tests</td></tr>
</table>

<!--
<p class="CommandDefinition">output_log <i>on</i>|<i>off</i></p>
<p class="CommandDescription">
Replicates the output log on the screen while snapspec runs.
</p>
<p class="CommandDefinition">test_config_options <i>option_code</i></p>
<p class="CommandDescription">
Defines some controls on how the analysis is performed.  The option_code is formed by adding the following values:
</p>
<table class="CommandDescription">
<tr><td>1</td><td>Defines whether relative accuracy tests run in two passes which allows only the required covariance
matrix elements to be calculated.  This is set by snapspec if the binary file includes the Choleski decomposition.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Allows the relative accuracy  tests to be short circuited if the test can be passed or failed 
based on the endpoint station variances without accounting for correlation.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Makes the short circuited relative accuracy tests more strict.  By default they assume that station
coordinates will not be negatively correlated, so the covariance is no more than the sum of the variances.
</td></tr>
